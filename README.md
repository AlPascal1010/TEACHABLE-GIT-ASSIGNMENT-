1. Explain Version control: Version control is a process of tracking changes to files over time. It allows multiple people to work on a project and keep track of changes, ensuring that everyone is working on the most up-to-date version. Version control systems also provide the ability to compare different versions, revert to previous versions, and track the history of changes.


2. Explain difference between git and github:
Git is a version control system that allows users to track changes in their code locally, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and enables collaboration.

Git is a command-line tool that is used for version control and managing code repositories, while GitHub provides a graphical user interface and additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.

Git is an open-source project maintained by a community of developers, while GitHub is a commercial platform owned by Microsoft that offers both free and paid plans for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on software projects.


3. List 3 other github alternatives: GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge


4. Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull: git fetch is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them, while git pull is used to retrieve and merge the changes from the remote repository into the current branch.


5. Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it:
Git rebase is a command used in the Git to change the base of a branch. This means that it allows you to move the starting point of a branch to a different commit.
The command for git rebase is: git rebase <base-branch>

6. Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it:
Git cherry-pick is a command used to copy a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch, without merging the entire branch. 
The command for it is "git cherry-pick <commit-hash>". to get commit hash you need to first run git log <branch-name> to get the hash code of the needed commit, it can also be used to merge more than one commit, with this syntax "git cherry-pick <commit-hash-1 commit-hash-2 ..... commit-hash-n>"
